## About 
An easy to understand and implement password manager that efficiently stores account details of various websites. The passwords, before storing, are encrypted using the ROT cipher. When a user retrieves a password, it is decrypted back into its original form.
To use the password manager, the user is first required to create a master account<br>
Programming Language: **Python 3.8.5** <br>

## Implementation 
- Open CMD, navigate to the working directory. Type in:  ```python Password_Manager.py``` or double click the code file to execute the program.
- If the user is using the manager for the first time, he/she will be required to create a master account. Thereafter, the user can just login using these master credentials.
- After logging in, the user has the options to store the account details of a specific site, retrieve account details or exit the manager.
- When the user enters his/her account details, the password is encrypted before storing. The encryption is done using a ROT cipher.
- If the user chooses to view his account details, the password is decrypted and the details are displayed.

- Enter the details of existing Password Manager account or create a new one.
- Once logged into the account, run the program again to store, retrieve or delete the account/account details of a given site.

## Notes 
- Only **ONE** account's details (the most recent one) will be stored.
